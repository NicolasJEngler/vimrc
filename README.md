# Personal Vim config

This is my personal .vimrc file. It uses [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for dependencies, so make sure to run the following commands:

1. Install `vim-plug` by opening up your terminal and running
 ```
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```
2. Keep in mind this setup also uses `airline`, which is included in the dependencies for `vim-plug` 
3. Reload Vim
4. Run `vim` to open up Vim
5. Run `:PlugInstall` to install all dependencies
6. Attaboy!
